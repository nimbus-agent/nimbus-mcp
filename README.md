# @nimbus-dev/mcp

## What this is

A tiny launcher that exposes your local [Nimbus](https://nimbus-agent.dev) index and agents to
any [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) client — editors, chat clients,
or other MCP-speaking tools. It does no work itself: it locates the Nimbus CLI binary already
installed on your machine and execs it as `nimbus mcp-server --stdio`, then gets out of the way and
lets stdio pass straight through.

This package is MIT-licensed and does not depend on (or import from) the AGPL-3.0 `packages/cli` or
`packages/gateway` Nimbus source — it only knows how to *find* the installed binary, never how to
run the gateway itself.

**Requires the Nimbus gateway to already be installed.** This launcher does not install or bundle
Nimbus; run the regular Nimbus installer first, and keep the gateway configured the way you
normally use it (the `mcp-server --stdio` command talks to your existing local index).

## Install

> **Not published to npm yet.** `@nimbus-dev/mcp` has no release-please entry and no publish
> workflow — registry submission is deliberately deferred to a release activity. The `npm` / `npx`
> instructions below are what you will use **once it is published**; until then, use
> [Running from a local checkout](#running-from-a-local-checkout).

Run it directly, without a global install, from your MCP client's config (see below), or install it
explicitly:

```bash
npm install -g @nimbus-dev/mcp
```

## Quickstart

Add `nimbus-mcp` as a command in your MCP client's server configuration, for example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nimbus": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@nimbus-dev/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Running from a local checkout

Until the package is published, point your MCP client straight at the launcher's entry point in a
clone of the [Nimbus](https://github.com/nimbus-agent/Nimbus) repository. Use absolute paths — an
editor-spawned MCP server does not inherit your shell's working directory:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nimbus": {
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/nimbus-mcp/src/index.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

If you already have the Nimbus CLI installed, you can skip the launcher altogether and have your
client run `nimbus mcp-server --stdio` directly — the launcher exists only to find that binary for
you.

### How the binary is found

The launcher looks for the Nimbus binary in this order:

1. `NIMBUS_BIN` — an explicit full path to the binary, if set. A `NIMBUS_BIN` that points at a
   non-existent file is reported as an error, never silently ignored.
2. `PATH` — the first `nimbus` (or `nimbus.exe` on Windows) found on your `PATH`.
3. Known per-platform install directories, the installer's own output directory first:
   `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Nimbus\bin` on Windows, `~/.local/bin` on macOS and Linux, then
   `/opt/homebrew/bin` and `/usr/local/bin` (macOS) or `/usr/local/bin` and `/usr/bin` (Linux).

Step 3 is what carries a GUI-launched editor on macOS, which typically spawns MCP servers without
your shell's `PATH`. If none of those resolve, the launcher exits with a message naming the fix —
never a bare exit code.

### Environment variables

- `NIMBUS_BIN` — override the resolved binary path. Point it at the exact Nimbus CLI executable.
- `NIMBUS_MCP_TIMEOUT_MS` — how long the Nimbus **CLI's MCP adapter** waits for an agent brief
  before returning a clean timeout error; it defaults to 60 s. Lower it when your editor's own MCP
  transport timeout is shorter, so the tool reports a timeout instead of having the call severed
  underneath it. This is the adapter's own budget — the gateway imposes no such timeout. It is read
  by the underlying `nimbus mcp-server` process, which this launcher execs with your environment
  inherited unchanged.
